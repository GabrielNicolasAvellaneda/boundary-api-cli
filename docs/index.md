Boundary CLIs
-------------

Boundary CLI provides command line access to a subset of the Boundary REST APIs as documented [http://premium-documentation.boundary.com/overview](http://premium-documentation.boundary.com/overview).

The Boundary CLIs are implemented in Python and require version 2.7.x or later be installed (NOTE: Python 3.x is currently not supported). The pip package is distributed via PyPi [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/boundary](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/boundary).
